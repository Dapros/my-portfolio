Dapros - Sergio Romero
This is my web portfolio created by me, in which I add and will continue to add personal information about my profile as a frontEnd developer and later fullStack.

Details
The structure of my web portfolio consists of a profile about me, to make myself known to people who want to know a little more about me or my profile. As well as the sample of my projects and contributions, until finally reaching the contact section.

If you like my web portfolio, don't forget to leave me a star rating.
